Reply all much? Even if you don't this could be nify.

A chrome addon adds a little html signature to your gmail/apps emails. The snippet contains 10 links numbered from 0 to 9. Instead replying, just click a link! Higher means you agree, lower means nay. The link records your vote and takes you to the discussion page. One a number of comments and votes are recorded an email goes out. If the original email was sent to the app everyone in the conversation is postd on the results. If not the sender get either a breakdown email for each voted email or a summary at the end of the day.
